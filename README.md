# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

- The motivation was to get a basic understanding of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
- I built this project to start laying the groundwork of learning these coding languages.
- What problem does it solve? It solves the problems of laying the HTMl foundation, stylizing the GUI with CSS, working with branches and iterating in Git, as well as how to create functions and what is needed to create them within Javascript.
- I learned this will be a lot more difficult than I thought, but with time will become easier and satisfactory.
